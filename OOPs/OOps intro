*************************************************************************** OOPs **************************************************************************************

OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. 
Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, 
while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.


Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions)
with which they are associated. It also includes ideas of inheritance of attributes and methods.



********************************************************************What are the 4 basics of OOP? ************************************************************************

Now, there are four fundamental concepts of Object-oriented programming â€“ 
Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Data abstraction. It is very important to know about all of these in order to understand OOPs.

In programming langauge we can se we write functions based on verbs, eg - >> mergeSort() , quickSort() etc.
but in OOPs we can name Object and Classes based on noun , eg ->> student swati {
                                                                                String name;
                                                                                int age;
                                                                                sayHii();
                                                                                boolean isTall; 
                                                                                  },  
                                                                                  
etc (where swati has some attributes  like swati is adjective , age is adjective , sayhii() is verb;)
